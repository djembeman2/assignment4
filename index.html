  <h1>Attributes</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Attributes go in the opening tag of the HTML Element. They are used to change the behavior of the Element in a
    specific way. Each tag will have attributes specific to it. Check MDN or w3schools to know which attributes to use
    with which tags.
  </p>

  <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
  <p>
    The Abbr tag has an attribute called title.
    Check this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_abbr.asp">link</a> for details. Try hovering over an abbr tag
    with your mouse!
  </p>
  A webpage is written in
  <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langauge">HTML</abbr>, which is the language that specifies how the page should look
  when rendered by a browser. Each webpage will have an address, or <abbr>URL</abbr>. An anchor tag is used to create a
  link to a webpage. Another name for this is a <abbr>href</abbr>, which is also the name of the anchor tag's attribute.
  Webpages are typically served over the protocols <abbr>http</abbr> or <abbr>https</abbr>.

  <h2>Tables</h2>

  <p>Tables are for tabular data. They also specify a certain layout on the page. Tables have an attibute of border. Try
    changing the border attribute.</p>

  <table border="1">
    <tr>
      <td>Eggs</td>
      <td>$2.99</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Bread</td>
      <td>$5.49</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Milk</td>
      <td>$4.89</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Images</h2>
  <p>
    Images displayed on the page can be linked from your server or a remote server.
  </p>
